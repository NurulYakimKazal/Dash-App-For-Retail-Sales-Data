# Dash-App-For-Retail-Sales-Data

This project simply redesigns of the already built dashboard by Anmol Tomar. 
You can visit his medium article to see the detail explanation of the dashboard (https://anmol3015.medium.com/python-dashboard-using-plotly-dash-example-2-f4fc0cc8a24c). 
In addition, you can visit his github to see the source code (https://github.com/Anmol3015/Plotly_Dash_examples). 

In this new design, there are two main changes which I applied to it, namely:
1.	The theme.
2.	The layout. This enables the dashboard to be responsive to the different screen widths.

For its technical details, the dashboard is built by taking advantage of some Python libraries, including:
1.	dash
2.	dash-bootstrap-components
3.	plotly
4.	pandas
5.	numpy

The dash and dash-bootstrap-components are used to build the layout and functionality of the dashboard, while plotly is used for creating the graphs displayed on it. 
Furthermore, the pandas and numpy are utilized for dealing with the data.
